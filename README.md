# 💄 Buckhain's World 🌟

Welcome to **Buckhain's World**, a whimsical realm where the love for makeup meets the power of technology. This is a place where every brush stroke, every shade, and every palette tells a story. Created by me, Buckhain, as a sanctuary to keep track of all the beautiful things in the world of makeup that catch my eye. 💖

## Purpose 🎨

**Buckhain's World** is more than just a database; it's a celebration of colors, creativity, and personal expression. Powered by Node.js, this API is my digital makeup bag, designed to catalog and cherish the makeup products I adore. From glittering eyeshadows to bold lipsticks, each item holds a place in my heart and now, in my database.

### Features:

- Add your favorite makeup products to a personalized list.
- Contribute by sharing those hidden gems - the underrated but fabulous makeup products.
- Discover new trends and explore the vast world of makeup.

## Getting Started 🚀

Ready to dive into this colorful journey? Here's how to get started:

1. **Set up your environment**:
   - Copy the `.env.template` file to a new file named `.env`.
   - Fill it with your own secret ingredients (configuration details).

2. Launch Buckhain's World: 🌈✨

Welcome to the backstage of Buckhain's World, where the magic happens! To bring this fabulous world to life, follow these steps with a dash of sparkle:

Start the Core Application:

Wave your magic wand (or just your cursor) and run the enchanting command: docker-compose up --build. This spell will build and start the main application, laying down the foundation of our makeup wonderland.
Awaken the API Spirits:

Next, let's add some life to our world. Navigate to the api folder like you're walking down a runway. There, strut your stuff with npm run start. This little trick will wake up our API spirits, ready to cater to all your makeup needs.
Summon the Color Wizardry:

For the grand finale, we need a burst of color! Move gracefully into the osc folder, where our color wizard awaits. With a graceful flick, execute node websocket-server.js. This will summon our color wizard, who, with the help of the mystical TouchOSC app and TouchDesigner, brings the hues of your dreams into Buckhain's World. Imagine painting with all the colors of the wind!
With these steps, you're not just starting an application; you're opening the doors to a universe where every color tells a story, every brand has its charm, and every product is a piece of art. Get ready to immerse yourself in the glamour and fantasy of Buckhain's World – where beauty and technology dance together in perfect harmony! 💖👩‍🎨💻
